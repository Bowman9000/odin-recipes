   <h2>How to cook</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sushi rice: Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Pour the mixture over the rice and gently fold to combine. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Prepare the fillings: While the rice is cooling, prepare your fillings. Slice the fish into thin strips, and julienne the cucumber and avocado.</li>
        <li>Assemble the sushi: Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down. Wet your hands to prevent sticking, then spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top. Arrange the fish and vegetables in a line across the center of the rice.</li>
        <li>Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the sushi away from you, pressing gently to shape the roll. Seal the edge with a little water. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve: Using a sharp knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.</li>
