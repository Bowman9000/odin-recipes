        <li>Cook the patties: Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired doneness. Add a slice of cheddar cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>        
        <li>Toast the buns: While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
        <li>Assemble the hamburgers: Spread your preferred condiments on the bottom half of each bun. Place a lettuce leaf on top, followed by the cooked patty with melted cheese. Add slices of tomato, onion, and pickles. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Serve the hamburgers immediately with your favorite sides.</li>
